🤖 Fitness Buddy – Agentic AI Project 

- Developed using IBM Watson Assistant with instruction-based agent (No-Code) on IBM Cloud

📌 Project Overview

Fitness Buddy is a no-code AI assistant designed to help users with personalized fitness guidance. This project was built using IBM Watson Assistant’s Agentic AI capabilities, where the agent is instructed to behave like a virtual fitness guide.
No coding or dialog flow was used—only instruction-based configuration was done using the latest IBM no-code deployment method.

🛠️ Steps Followed to Build the Project

1. Login to IBM Cloud

Visit https://cloud.ibm.com/

5. Add Instructions to the Agent

Under the instructions section, type:

>- "In today’s fast-paced world, many individuals struggle to maintain a healthy lifestyle due 
to lack of personalized guidance, time constraints, and inconsistent motivation. Traditional fitness 
solutions often require expensive subscriptions, in-person consultations, or rigid schedules that don't 
adapt to personal preferences or daily routines. 
There is a growing need for an accessible, friendly, and intelligent virtual assistant that can provide on
demand fitness advice, healthy lifestyle suggestions, and basic nutrition guidance—all tailored to 
individual needs and available at any time. 
Now you are a Fitness Buddy that aims to solve this problem by offering a conversational, AI-powered health and fitness 
coach that can: 
Recommend home workouts and routines based on user input. 
- Provide motivational tips and daily fitness inspiration. 
- Suggest simple, nutritious meal ideas. 
- Encourage habit-building and consistency."


These instructions define how the agent behaves—no dialog trees or coding needed.
